    <h2 class="subhead2">1.CEREC CAD/CAM</h2>
    <div class="flexcont">
        <p class="text paraimg">CEREC is the short term for Chairside Economical Restoration of Esthetic Ceramics, or CEramic REConstruction. CEREC uses CAD/CAM (computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing) technology to take impressions quickly and generate a precisely fitted filling so you can leave Discovery Dental sooner.
        How can CEREC help you?One of the biggest advantages of CEREC is its convenience. If you need a crown, inlay, or onlay, you can get your teeth restored during a single trip to Discovery Dental. Traditionally, these procedures require two trips to the dentist.
        During the first, the dentist cleans the tooth, makes a mold, and places a temporary restoration onto the tooth. In a couple of weeks, after the permanent restoration is ready, you need to return to the office so that the dentist can remove the temporary fix and place the permanent one.
        The CEREC process lets you receive your permanent restoration right here in our Washougal, WA office, so you do not have to live for weeks with a temporary fix and schedule another appointment. In addition, Dr. Dave Stinchfield and Dr. Tom Stinchfield and our team use digital impressions to make a mold for the filling. This is more comfortable and accurate than traditional impressions with plaster.</p>

    <p class="text paraimg">Dental Implants are Bio compatible Titanium roots that are placed into the jaw bone by highly experienced doctors in implantology to derive support for replacing lost teeth. Though nothing can replace the joy of having natural teeth the next best option is dental implants .
        <br>Various treatment modalities of Implants are :
        <br>Single tooth implants Implant supported bridges Implant supported dentures Full mouth rehabilitation.<br>In general, dental implants may be right for you if you:
    <br>If your jawbone isn't thick enough or is too soft, you may need bone grafting before you can have dental implant surgery. That's because the powerful chewing action of your mouth exerts great pressure on your bone, and if it can't support the implant, the surgery likely would fail. A bone graft can create a more solid base for the implant.There are several bone graft materials that can be used to rebuild a jawbone. Options may include a natural bone graft, such as from another location in your body, or a synthetic bone graft, 
        It may take several months for the transplanted bone to grow enough new bone to support a dental implant. In some cases, you may need only minor bone grafting, which can be done at the same time as the implant surgery. The condition of your jawbone determines how you proceed.

    <h2 class="subhead2">3.Laser</h2>
    <div class="flexcont">
        <p class="text paraimg"> Introduced multipurpose laser first of its kind in India. Painless dentistry has entered a new era with Lasers. An amplified high energy light source replaces the dental drill and scalpel which patients have feared for many years. At I SMILE DENTAL ARENA, we use lasers for the following applications.
            Implant surgeries: frenectomy Removal of tooth decay Gum lightening Disinfection during root canal therapy<br>Common soft tissue procedures include:

            Treating a “gummy smile.” Lasers are used to reshape gum tissue associated with “gummy smile,” in which the gums length covers much of the tooth.
            Crown lengthening. This procedure reshapes both gum tissue and bone for healthier tooth structure, which helps with placing restorations on the teeth.
            Treating tongue frenulum attachment. Those with a thick or tight frenulum (the fold of skin under the front part of tongue that anchors to the mouth floor) may benefit from a laser frenectomy. This treatment helps children whose restricted frenulum causes them to be tongue-tied, have difficulty breastfeeding, or have a speech impediment.
            Removing soft tissue folds. Lasers can remove soft tissue folds from ill-fitting dentures without pain or sutures.  </p>
